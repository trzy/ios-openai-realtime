# OpenAI Realtime Audio API on iOS with SwiftUI

This is a minimalistic example of OpenAI's new [Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) for iOS with SwiftUI.
The assistant supports interruption.

A single function, `get_weather`, is implemented, so you can ask, for example, "What should I wear today?"

It ain't much... but it'll get you started.
